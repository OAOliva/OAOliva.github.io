										<h2>About Me</h2>
										<p>Thanks for taking the time to visit my website,<br />
										here is a little more about myself.</p>
									</header>
									<p>I am currently studying at the University of Pittsburgh pursuing a degree in mechanical engineering and a bioengineering minor with an expected graduation date in April 2025. I am firm in my belief that there is no substitute for experience when it comes to preparing to enter the work force, and experiences in different industries and settings can build on each other to create a well-rounded engineer. This belief has driven me to search for as many opportunities as I can since my sophomore year in college and has landed me three different positions as a research assistant, a mechanical engineering intern, and as a co-op on two different engineering teams in the same company. Each of these positions has shaped tremendously and given me a perspective on engineering that uniquely ties the three different industries that I have worked in together. 
										<br />
										<br />
										I made this website because I don't think that everything that I have done to prepare myself to be an engineer can be encapsulated in a resume, or short cover letter. This website serves as an addition to those, so I encourage you to start with my resume, and if anything catches your attention there, then you will find it most useful to find those topics here. The section “Professional Projects” is the most in-depth dive into what I have done at my internships with specific tasks, while the section “Work Experience” looks more at everything that I learned while working at those companies. The “Personal Projects” section only showcases relevant projects that I found interesting and worked on in my own time. You do not need to read this entire website to gain a full understanding of what I know and am capable of, so please look at anything and everything that you are interested in and don't feel pressured to read everything.

											<h4>ZOLL LifeVest</h4>
											<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Zoll-LifeVest.png" alt="" /></span>I was a co-op on the human factors engineering team at ZOLL for three four-month rotations, and I also had the opportunity to work on the advanced research / advanced development team for one summer after my final co-op rotation. On the human factors team, my main responsibilities had to do with the different studies we conducted where we recruit participants which were representative of the end user population to test the product that we were looking at and provide feedback on their experience. These studies served one of two purposes, to test safety and ensure that the device minimizes risk in accordance with FDA regulations, or to support the design teams and bridge the gap between them and the end users. This experience taught me so much more than most realize, since it was not a conventional engineering experience. I learned how important it is to design with the end user in mind, and how to set up the design process so this is always what guides decisions made along the way. I learned how important it is to test early and at times fail early but to fail early so the project can pivot in the right direction. My mentors coached me so I could interact with participants more fluidly, and so I could effectively communicate during presentations with other engineers. They edited my documents and showed me what I was doing wrong, and at the end of my co-op it was obvious how much I had improved. My communication and presentation skills were also something that I greatly improved throughout this experience. <br />
												<br />
												My time on the advanced research/advanced development team was quite different, however. During this summer I took a lot more of a lead role in all my projects. I was given little direction on what I should be doing and instead was given the freedom to explore any ideas that I had. If I thought of something that would improve the LifeVest, then I was encouraged to explore those ideas. Throughout my projects, I used more technical skills such as 3D modeling in SolidWorks and coding which was mostly done in python. I analyzed signal quality using Fourier transforms to help me make decisions on the fabric electrode project which is further described in the professional projects section of this website. I learned or improved different prototyping skills such as sewing, soldering, and injection molding. The most important thing I learned was that I really didn’t know everything, and I learned how to communicate and learn from others who knew a lot more than me and apply what they taught me to my projects quickly.

											<h4>Human Movement and Balance Laboratory (HMBL)</h4>
											<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/HMBL.png" alt="" /></span>I began working at the Human Movement and Balance Laboratory (HMBL) in the fall of my sophomore year and worked there every semester that I have taken classes since. I usually work around 10 hours a week, balancing my time between classes, homework, and my time at the lab. In my time in research, I was given projects that had never been done before so I had to be innovative and come up with ways to make something work, even if it didn't look very nice at first. I had to turn into a bit of a chameleon and learn how to do a little bit of everything. I started by working on a test procedure to test the coefficient of friction of ladder rungs. I learned how to use the machine shop to build test fixtures and custom parts. I wrote test procedures that were used by other engineers reliably gather data, and I used MATLAB to analyze and present the data that was gathered. In my latest project, I learned how to write MATLAB code that does image processing and write code for a Raspberry Pi. We have hopes of publishing this latest project in the coming months.

											<h4>Desapro</h4>
											<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Desapro.jpg" alt="" /></span>Desapro was my first internship in the summer after my sophomore year. Desapro manufactures custom aluminum containers and boxes, many of which protect expensive or sensitive equipment, and is commonly used to transport military equipment such as missiles. My main responsibility was modeling these containers in SolidWorks and drafting drawings that were used in production. I my homed in my SolidWorks skills and got a lot of practice working with assemblies. My manager strongly believed that engineers could not properly do their work if they did not understand how the material worked in the real world, the manufacturing processes that work best, and why some models that appear to work on 3D models don't work when implemented. As a result, I had the privilege of shadowing machine shop workers, thereby gaining valuable insights into the practical applications of spot and gas welding, sheet metal stamping and bending processes.

									<h3>Projects</h3>
									<p>Here are a list of a few projects I completed in my own time for fun or to teach myself something new, with exception of the first project which was completed in my sendior design class.</p>

												<h4>Wall Squat Machine</h4>
												<p>This was my senior capstone project which was completed with four other students in the class. We were tasked with designing and building a wall squat machine for lower body injury rehabilitation. We set a plan for ourselves and documented every stage of the design process. We met with our sponsor every week to give updates on where we were at and adjust our design to meet the requirements and specifications that we came up with together. We built an assembly in SolidWorks and machined the custom parts to match our design. We assembled the squat machine and made last minute adjustments when we found out that a part we ordered did not work as we thought it would. Our final design implemented a hydraulic system to reduce the load that the patient would have to apply themselves while completing a squat with full range of motion. A harness would support the weight of the patient during the squat. It was adjustable for patients of different sizes to comfortably use. Moving components of the hydraulic system were concealed in the back for safety and to be aesthetically pleasing. Full squat depth and range of motion of the knee was possible for patients ranging from 4' to 6'2" in height, and could hold patients that weighed up to 300 lbs. </p>

											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Automatic Watering System</h4>
												<p>Designed an automated watering system for decorative plants in my house that measures moisture levels in the soil and pumps a preset amount of water if the moisture level drops below a specified number. This was done using an Arduino Nano connected to a battery, two water sensors, and a water pump. To deliver the required voltage to the water pump, which the Arduino does not output, the water pump was connected directly to the battery with a transistor functioning as an on/off switch. A small case was designed in SolidWorks to contain the Arduino and other electronic components (other than the pump and moisture sensors) and 3D printed. A tube was also 3D printed which circled the plant to evenly disperse the water. Once the system was set up, the only maintenance  that was needed was refilling a large bucket of water and replacing the battery once it was depleted. </p>

											<a class="image"><img src="images/Car.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Car</h4>
												<p>The purpose of this project was to learn about programming Arduinos and served as an introduction to robotics. I bought a kit off of Amazon which provided the parts to assemble the car, an Arduino, four motors, a remote control, and several different sensors that can be used for projects as needed. I programmed the car to do several things including line following, navigating around a room without hitting anything, and to be controlled by the remote control that came with the car. Though this was an introductory project, I taught myself everything for it and in the process, I learned a lot that I would not have learned if I had someone teach me or I had learned it in a structured format such as in a class. I learned a little bit about I2C communication, how to work around unexpected challenges on my own, and most importantly I practiced teaching myself new skills.</p>

												<h4>Lamp Art Display</h4>
												<p>The lamp art display was a joint project between myself and a roommate majoring in art and architecture who had the idea for this lamp. The lamp was constructed using acrylic pieces which were laser cut as 2D shapes in such a way that when put together they would form the shape of a pill. The cylinder portion was made from half ovals, and spherical end caps at the top and bottom were made from two different sized triangles. Connecting pieces held the triangles and ovals together. My roommate came up with the overall design and hand drew the lamp and how he wanted the individual pieces to look so that it fit his artistic view. Using his design, I determined the angle of the connecting pieces of the cylinder</p>

										<h4>Fabric Electrode Garment - ZOLL</h4>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/FabricElectrodeBelt.jpeg" alt="" /></span>In this project, my mentor and I worked side by side to develop a prototype LifeVest garment and electrode belt that swapped out the existing ECGs with a conductive fabric pressed against the patient’s skin to read their heartbeat. I made a small rubber disk that the conductive fabric would wrap around to hold the same shape as the ECG pucks that were already used. I connected the conductive fabric to the existing circuit boards that did all the signal processing, noise reduction, and amplification. The first iteration could successfully read the ECG signal of the user, but a lot of noise was introduced during, especially during movement. We were not sure exactly where the noise was coming from so I started out by developing a test to compare different conductive fabrics and how well they transferred the signal, and how well they would hold up after repeated laundering. I also worked to make the connection from the ECG pucks to the circuit board as rigid as possible to reduce the movement and friction seen in the wires. I sewed the garments that we used so that they could hold the new electrode belt, and sewed the wires down so they would not move around. In parallel to reducing noise we were picking up, I used SolidWorks to model and 3-D print housings for circuit boards. I found a different way to ground the signal instead of using the existing conductive mesh that was very expensive to buy. We went through several different iterations which I quickly put together and tested, and by the end of my time there, the prototype that we made was cheaper, and more comfortable than the original garment and under specific test conditions, we did not sacrifice signal quality. <br />

										<h4>Electrode Placement Study - ZOLL</h4>
										<p>This project looked at different placements that we could move the electrodes on the LifeVest to increase ECG amplitude which allows for better identification of the user’s heartrate. My mentor and I wrote a test protocol and recruited members of the R&D team to participate in the study. To accurately measure the participants’ body and consistently place the electrodes in the correct position for each person, we scanned each participant with a 3D scanner. We used python to take a slice of the person around where their heart would be and measure the person’s circumference and give us measurements of where to place the electrodes for each test. There were four total electrodes that we placed 90 degrees apart from each other around the body. These four electrodes could make six different vectors across the body that we could measure the ECG signal through. We moved the four electrodes around the body to five different locations including the normal placement. We used python to create a heat map and rank the amplitude of the ECG signal and found that over 10 different vectors that we analyzed had higher amplitude than the normal placement. The heatmap also revealed that better placements may still exist that we did not test for, and further testing should be conducted to find an optimal placement for the electrodes. <br /></p>

										<h4><Fieldset>FTIR - HMBL</Fieldset></h4>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/FTIR.jpg" alt="" /></span>I am currently working on this project where we are using frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR) technology to measure how worn-down shoe tread is. The refractive index between acrylic and air is such that light will not escape the medium that we have set up, and instead will continue to reflect within the medium. When someone steps on the acrylic plate of the device, the refractive index changes and light can escape, but only where the shoe and the acrylic are touching and there is no air in between them. I set up a Raspberry Pi and a small camera to take a picture of the shoe tread that is lit up. I then wrote a script in python that takes a picture and saves it when the user presses a button. I also used MATLAB to do all the image processing that tells us what part of the picture is lit up, the parts in contact with the shoe. This script also gives us the area of the largest illuminated continuous section of the shoe. This area can tell us how worn down the shoe tread is and if the user is at risk of slipping and falling because of how worn their shoe is. We are planning on submitting this work and presenting it at a conference in the coming months. <br /></p>

										<h4><Fieldset>Ladder Rung Friction Testing - HMBL</Fieldset></h4>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/FrictionTester.jpg" alt="" /></span>This was the first project that I had the opportunity to work on while I was at HMBL in my sophomore year of college. I was tasked with developing a testing procedure and building the necessary equipment to measure the coefficient of friction in ladder rungs. The machine that we were using, shown in the picture, would slide a shoe across the ladder rung, measure the normal force and force it would take to pull the shoe across the surface of the ladder, and calculate the coefficient of friction. I used the machine shop in the lab to build the fixture that the attached the shoe to the machine, and the fixture that would attach the ladder rung to the base of the machine while allowing for ladder rungs to be changed quickly. The ladder rungs were also tested at different angles, so the fixture that attached the shoe to the device had to tilt the shoe to a different angle for this test. I then wrote the procedure that was used to test the ladder rungs under different conditions: dry, and contaminated with oil. This test had to be repeatable to test multiple ladder rungs with different people while still producing the same results.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
