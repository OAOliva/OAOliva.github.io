										<h2>About Me</h2>
										<p>Thanks for taking the time to visit my website,<br />
										here is a little more about myself.</p>
									</header>
									<p>I am currently pursuing a degree in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Bioengineering at the University of Pittsburgh, with an anticipated graduation date of April 2025. I firmly believe that hands-on experience is invaluable in preparing for a successful engineering career, as exposure to diverse industries and environments leads to the development of a well-rounded skill set. Driven by this belief, I have actively pursued opportunities since my sophomore year to build my skills and grow into a well-rounded engineer, leading to three distinct roles: research assistant, mechanical engineering intern, and co-op on the human factors and advanced research/development teams, both within the same organization. These experiences have been instrumental in shaping my perspective, allowing me to draw connections between the unique aspects of the three industries I have worked in, and contributing to my growth as an engineer.
										<br />
										<br />
										I created this website to provide a more comprehensive view of my journey and all the preparation I have done to become an engineer. I believe that a traditional resume or cover letter cannot fully encapsulate the breadth of my experiences. This website has a lot of information and is designed to complement those materials, so I encourage you to begin with my resume. If anything there piques your interest, you’ll find more detailed information here. The "Professional Projects" section offers an in-depth look at the specific tasks and accomplishments from my internships, while the "Work Experience" section provides a broader perspective on the skills and lessons I gained during my time at these organizations. The "Personal Projects" section highlights select self-initiated projects that I found both engaging and relevant. This site is not intended to be read in its entirety—feel free to explore the sections that interest you most to gain a deeper understanding of my skills and capabilities.									</p>

											<h4>ZOLL LifeVest</h4>
											<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Zoll-LifeVest.png" alt="" /></span>I completed three four-month rotations as a co-op with the Human Factors Engineering team at ZOLL, followed by an additional summer opportunity with the Advanced Research/Advanced Development team after my final co-op rotation. During my time with the Human Factors team, I learned the importance of designing with the end user in mind and how to structure the design process to ensure user needs drive decision-making at every stage. I led studies, conducting interviews with the target population to identify areas for product improvement. I then communicated these findings to cross-functional engineering teams, collaborating closely to refine the products in alignment with user requirements. My mentors provided guidance to help me interact more effectively with participants and to communicate technical information clearly during presentations. Through this experience, I learned the value of early-stage testing and the necessity of failing quickly in order to pivot projects in the right direction. I designed studies to assess both the strengths and weaknesses of each project, using the results to inform key adjustments and guide development efforts. By the conclusion of my co-op, I had developed strong communication, technical writing, and presentations skills and I became proficient in steering projects efficiently toward successful outcomes.<br />
												<br />
												My time with the Advanced Research/Advanced Development team offered a very distinct experience. During this summer, I assumed a leadership role in my projects, working with minimal direction and leveraging the freedom to explore innovative ideas. This position required the application of advanced technical skills, including 3D modeling in SolidWorks and programming primarily in Python. One of my key projects involved the development of a fabric electrode belt, where I performed tasks such as sewing the components together, soldering electrical elements, analyzing signal quality using Fourier transforms to inform material selection, and creating test procedures to quantify the performance of conductive fabrics over time. Additionally, I employed 3D scanning techniques to track electrode positions on the body, correlating their placement with signal amplitude in an electrode placement study. One of the most valuable lessons from this experience was the importance of seeking guidance from the engineers who know much more than I and rapidly applying what I learned to drive my projects forward. This role not only honed my technical abilities but also deepened my ability to innovate and collaborate effectively.											</p>

											<h4>Human Movement and Balance Laboratory (HMBL)</h4>
											<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/HMBL.png" alt="" /></span>I began working at the Human Movement and Balance Laboratory (HMBL) during the fall of my sophomore year and have returned every semester since. Balancing approximately 10 hours per week between my academic responsibilities and laboratory work, I have gained extensive hands-on experience in research and engineering applications. My projects often involved uncharted territory, requiring me to adapt and broaden my skill set to bring brand new ideas into fruition. 
												<br />
												In my first project, which focused on testing the coefficient of friction of ladder rungs, I developed a comprehensive test procedure that was used by other lab members to reliably collect data. I then used MATLAB to analyze and visualize the collected data. Additionally, I enhanced my machine shop skills by building test fixtures for the ladder rungs and shoe components.
												<br />
												In my most recent project, I utilized Frustrated Total Internal Reflection (FTIR) technology to research wear regions on shoes. I wrote a MATLAB script to process images by dewarping them, identifying shoe contact regions, separating continuous wear regions, and calculating the area of the largest continuous worn region. Currently, I am working on correlating the image brightness from the FTIR device to the pressure exerted by the shoe.

											<h4>Desapro</h4>
											<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Desapro.jpg" alt="" /></span>During the summer following my sophomore year, I completed my first internship at Desapro, a company specializing in the design and manufacturing of custom aluminum containers and boxes. These containers are designed to protect sensitive and high-value equipment and are widely utilized for transporting military assets, including missile systems and different cameras and sensors. My primary responsibility was to model these containers in SolidWorks and create detailed production-ready drawings. This role allowed me to enhance my proficiency in SolidWorks, particularly in modeling and working with complex assemblies. Under the mentorship of my manager, who emphasized the importance of understanding materials and manufacturing processes, I gained a deeper appreciation for the practical challenges of translating 3D models into manufactured physical products. I had the unique opportunity to shadow skilled machinists in the shop, where I observed and learned about spot and gas welding techniques, as well as sheet metal stamping and bending processes. This hands-on exposure enriched my understanding of the manufacturing lifecycle and the nuances of ensuring design feasibility in real-world applications.

											<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/SeniorDesign.jpg" alt="" /></span>
												<h4>Wall Squat Machine</h4>
												For my senior capstone project, I collaborated with a team of four peers to design and build a wall squat machine for rehabilitation, aimed at improving muscle strength and restoring range of motion in the knee for individuals recovering from lower body injuries. The machine assists users who are unable to perform bodyweight squats by applying an upward force to support the movement. The team showcased the project at the senior design expo, where we won the People's Choice Award.<br />
												Our design process began with modeling the system in SolidWorks, including stress analysis on load-bearing components to ensure structural integrity. Detailed technical drawings were created for each part, facilitating the manufacturing phase. The machine was built using standard components which we ordered online and then machined to meet our specifications. Key design features included a sliding backrest equipped with armrests for user stability and a harness system to support the user's weight.<br />
												The upward assistance force was delivered via a hydraulic cylinder and pump assembly mounted at the rear of the machine, which is attached to the backrest. To accommodate a range of users, the armrests, harness, and squat depth were fully adjustable, with the machine supporting individuals weighing up to 350 pounds and up to 6'2" in height. <br />

											<h4>Automated Watering System</h4>
											<p>
											  The automated plant watering system is a solution to overwatering and underwatering, both of which negatively affect plant health. To mitigate these issues, I designed and implemented a fully automated watering system capable of monitoring soil moisture levels and delivering precise amounts of water when needed. The system utilizes an Arduino Nano powered by a battery and integrates two soil moisture sensors and a water pump to maintain optimal hydration levels. To overcome the Arduino's limited voltage output, the water pump was connected directly to the battery via a transistor functioning as an electronic switch. I designed and 3D-printed a custom enclosure in SolidWorks to house the Arduino and associated electronic components. Additionally, I 3D-printed a circular distribution tube to ensure even water dispersion around the plant. The system required minimal maintenance, with users only needing to periodically refill a large water reservoir and replace the battery upon depletion.

											<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Car.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
												<h4>Robotic Car</h4>
												This project served as an introduction to robotics and Arduino programming, providing a hands-on opportunity to explore embedded systems and sensor integration. Using a robotics kit purchased online, I assembled a programmable car equipped with an Arduino, four motors, a remote control, and a variety of sensors for versatile functionality. I wrote code to enable the car to perform multiple tasks including line following, obstacle avoidance, and remote-controlled operation. Although this was an introductory project, I approached it with a self-directed learning mindset, gaining valuable skills through experimentation and solving problems on my own. I deepened my understanding of I2C communication protocols, honed my ability to address unforeseen challenges, and cultivated essential skills in self-teaching and adaptability.

												<h4>Lamp Art Display</h4>
												<p>This lamp was a collaborative project between myself and a roommate, an art and architecture major, who had the idea for the lamp. The lamp was constructed from laser-cut 2D acrylic pieces that, when assembled, formed the silhouette of a pill. My roommate was responsible for the overall design, hand-drawing the layout and specifying the aesthetic vision for the individual components. I handled the technical aspects, performing the necessary calculations to determine the precise angles for each piece to ensure proper alignment. Additionally, I created a 3D assembly model in SolidWorks to validate the fit and functionality before assembling the lamp.</p>

												<h4>Balsa Wood Bridge</h4>
												This project was completed as the final assignment for Statics 1. It was designed to deepen our understanding of the stresses experienced by individual members of a truss bridge. Collaborating with a team of three other students, we engineered a balsa wood bridge optimized to support the maximum possible weight. Our process began with using MATLAB to calculate the stresses in each bridge member and refine the design by adding additional members and plotting the maximum stress distribution. Next, we created a detailed model of the bridge in SolidWorks and performed finite element analysis (FEA) to validate our calculated stresses and optimize the design further. Finally, we constructed the bridge using balsa wood and tested it by adding weight until failure.

										<h4>Fabric Electrode Garment - ZOLL</h4>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/FabricElectrodeBelt.jpeg" alt="" /></span>In this project, my mentor and I worked side by side to develop a prototype LifeVest garment and electrode belt that swapped out the existing ECGs with a conductive fabric pressed against the patient’s skin to read their heartbeat. I made a small rubber disk that the conductive fabric would wrap around to hold the same shape as the ECG pucks that were already used. I connected the conductive fabric to the existing circuit boards that did all the signal processing, noise reduction, and amplification. The first iteration could successfully read the ECG signal of the user, but a lot of noise was introduced during, especially during movement. We were not sure exactly where the noise was coming from so I started out by developing a test to compare different conductive fabrics and how well they transferred the signal, and how well they would hold up after repeated laundering. I also worked to make the connection from the ECG pucks to the circuit board as rigid as possible to reduce the movement and friction seen in the wires. I sewed the garments that we used so that they could hold the new electrode belt, and sewed the wires down so they would not move around. In parallel to reducing noise we were picking up, I used SolidWorks to model and 3-D print housings for circuit boards. I found a different way to ground the signal instead of using the existing conductive mesh that was very expensive to buy. We went through several different iterations which I quickly put together and tested, and by the end of my time there, the prototype that we made was cheaper, and more comfortable than the original garment and under specific test conditions, we did not sacrifice signal quality. <br />

										<h4>Electrode Placement Study - ZOLL</h4>
										<p>This project looked at different placements that we could move the electrodes on the LifeVest to increase ECG amplitude which allows for better identification of the user’s heartrate. My mentor and I wrote a test protocol and recruited members of the R&D team to participate in the study. To accurately measure the participants’ body and consistently place the electrodes in the correct position for each person, we scanned each participant with a 3D scanner. We used python to take a slice of the person around where their heart would be and measure the person’s circumference and give us measurements of where to place the electrodes for each test. There were four total electrodes that we placed 90 degrees apart from each other around the body. These four electrodes could make six different vectors across the body that we could measure the ECG signal through. We moved the four electrodes around the body to five different locations including the normal placement. We used python to create a heat map and rank the amplitude of the ECG signal and found that over 10 different vectors that we analyzed had higher amplitude than the normal placement. The heatmap also revealed that better placements may still exist that we did not test for, and further testing should be conducted to find an optimal placement for the electrodes. <br /></p>

										<h4><Fieldset>FTIR - HMBL</Fieldset></h4>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/FTIR.jpg" alt="" /></span>I am currently working on this project where we are using frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR) technology to measure how worn-down shoe tread is. The refractive index between acrylic and air is such that light will not escape the medium that we have set up, and instead will continue to reflect within the medium. When someone steps on the acrylic plate of the device, the refractive index changes and light can escape, but only where the shoe and the acrylic are touching and there is no air in between them. I set up a Raspberry Pi and a small camera to take a picture of the shoe tread that is lit up. I then wrote a script in python that takes a picture and saves it when the user presses a button. I also used MATLAB to do all the image processing that tells us what part of the picture is lit up, the parts in contact with the shoe. This script also gives us the area of the largest illuminated continuous section of the shoe. This area can tell us how worn down the shoe tread is and if the user is at risk of slipping and falling because of how worn their shoe is. We are planning on submitting this work and presenting it at a conference in the coming months. <br /></p>

										<h4><Fieldset>Ladder Rung Friction Testing - HMBL</Fieldset></h4>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/FrictionTester.jpg" alt="" /></span>This was the first project that I had the opportunity to work on while I was at HMBL in my sophomore year of college. I was tasked with developing a testing procedure and building the necessary equipment to measure the coefficient of friction in ladder rungs. The machine that we were using, shown in the picture, would slide a shoe across the ladder rung, measure the normal force and force it would take to pull the shoe across the surface of the ladder, and calculate the coefficient of friction. I used the machine shop in the lab to build the fixture that the attached the shoe to the machine, and the fixture that would attach the ladder rung to the base of the machine while allowing for ladder rungs to be changed quickly. The ladder rungs were also tested at different angles, so the fixture that attached the shoe to the device had to tilt the shoe to a different angle for this test. I then wrote the procedure that was used to test the ladder rungs under different conditions: dry, and contaminated with oil. This test had to be repeatable to test multiple ladder rungs with different people while still producing the same results.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
